# Task 2.
In this task, an interface is designed to control the movement of the arm in different directions forward, backward, right, left and stop.
The interface has also been integrated with the previous control interface, which contains the angles at which the arm moves.
CSS file formats were used and formats for fonts, sliders and images were developed to make an easy and clear interactive screen.
When dealing with the interface and pressing the send button or pressing the value of any button, that information is sent to the database and a single database has been created that contains a table with the items to be sent, so when the user chooses to move the arm to the left, the letter "l" appears in the direction column and so on, The value set by the user is also sent to each slider.
